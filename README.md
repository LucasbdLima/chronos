<h1>CHRONOS</h1>
<br>
<h2>This project was a personal challenge, in which I aimed to create a stopwatch application.The structure was developed using HTML and styling with CSS. A very simple layout was used with logos created with Canva. 
The application dynamics process was done with Javascript and its operation is basic, but it was enjoyable and challenging as a personal project, using new JS tools.</h2>
